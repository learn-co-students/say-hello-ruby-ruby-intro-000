# Build your say_hello method here
## Steps

# 1. Run `learn` to see where you stand.
#  * You probably got two NoMethodErrors. This means the test was looking for a method called `say_hello` but couldn't find it.
# 2. Define the method in `say_hello.rb`
#  * Run `learn` again. Are you getting a different error? If you haven't seen this error, guess what it's trying to tell you then Google it with the word "ruby".
# 3. Get all the tests to pass!
# 4. Once all of the tests are passing, use `learn submit` to submit your lab.

def say_hello(name = "Ruby Programmer")
  puts "Hello #{name}!"
